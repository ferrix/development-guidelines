# Contributing

## Pull requests only

*DON'T* push to the master branch directly. Always use pull requests and have at least two reviewer approvals.

## Content

1. Modify [DEVELOPMENT-GUIDELINES.md](src/DEVELOPMENT-GUIDELINES.md) with latest changes.
2. Update [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) accordingly with proper versioning.
3. Run `make build`
4. Run `make release`
5. Push your changes and create Merge Request to [GitHub](https://github.com/s-group-dev/development-guidelines).
6. Run `git push origin --tags`

## Versioning

When adding new changes, one should always also add an entry to changelog.

While doing so, please respect the following scheme:

- Adding or removing a new rule increases MINOR version
  - If the main section comes empty after removing the last rule, increase a MAJOR version
- Modifying some existing rule, but not changing its semantics increases PATCH version
- Moving existing rules from section to another, increase PATCH version
- Increasing any number sould always be in it's own release. Only update one at time

Versioning has `v` prefix and starts from `v1.0.0`.
